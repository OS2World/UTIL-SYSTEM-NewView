:p.:hp2.History:ehp2.
:p.NewView replaces the original IBM program supplied with OS&slash.2&per.
:p.It improves upon many aspects of View&comma. with a modern&comma. easy to use
interface&comma. more options&comma. and new features that View simply
didn&apos.t have&per.

etc&per. Be aware&comma. that many of these services are cheap for the
buyer&slash.donor&comma. but rather expensive for the "merchant" &endash.
hundreds of US dollars a year is not uncommon&per.
:p.:hp2.Reporting Bugs:ehp2.
:p.If you need to report a crash or other problem&comma. then be as specific as
possible about what files were being used&comma. what you were doing&comma.
etc&per. If one is available&comma. PLEASE include the newview&per.log&per. The
log file will be EITHER
.br
 &endash. in the same directory as NewView itself
.br
 &endash. in the folder set by LOGFILES environment variable &lpar.typically eCS
1&per.1&plus.&rpar.
.br
If it is specific to a particular help file&comma. then send them to me&comma.
unless they&apos.re large &lpar.bigger than 1MB&rpar.&per.
:p.Most of the following information is in the newview&per.log file&comma. but
it would be helpful if you could include it for verification&colon.
:p.o NewView version &lpar.Help &endash. Product Information&rpar.
:p.o The filenames of the help files&per.
:p.A screenshot may be useful&comma. if the problem is an incorrect or corrupt
display&per.
:p.:hp2.Why doesn&apos.t my help file work properly?:ehp2.
:p.Some of the less used features of the original View program are not
implemented&per. This is either because I have not got around to it&comma. or
because they are simply not worth the time&per. Examples include
metafiles&comma. index synonyms&comma. the entire application control API&comma.
and so on&per.
:p.Unfortunately&comma. it seems that at least one developer has used every one
of these features&comma. so you may find an occasional file that doesn&apos.t
load or doesn&apos.t work properly&per.
:h1 res=2 id='Using'.
Using NewView
:p.:hp2.Using NewView:ehp2.
:p.Once you have :link reftype=hd refid='OpeningFiles'.opened a
file:elink.&comma. you can read it in various ways&per.
:p.You can read the :link reftype=hd refid='contents'.table of
contents:elink.&comma. use the :link reftype=hd refid='Index'.alphabetical
index:elink.&comma. or :link reftype=hd refid='search'.search:elink.&per.
:p.To simply read the help file like a paper book&comma. use the "Previous"
:artwork runin name='images\previous.bmp'.
 and "Next"
:artwork runin name='images\next.bmp'.
 buttons to work your way through all the topics&per.
:p.You can also use the help file like web pages&comma. using "Back"
:artwork runin name='images\back.bmp'.
 and "Forward"
:artwork runin name='images\forward.bmp'.
 buttons to go back to wherever you were before&comma. or to retread your
steps&per.
:p.Colours and some of the behaviour of NewView can be adjusted from the Tools
&endash. Options menu&per.
:p.You can also :link reftype=hd refid='notes'.annotate:elink. or :link
reftype=hd refid='bookmarks'.bookmark:elink. topics&per.
:h1 res=3 id='OpeningFiles'.
Opening Files
:i1 id=30005.open
:p.:hp2.Opening Help Files:ehp2.
:p.
:p.To open a help file&comma. you can use any of the following&colon.
:p.&endash. Double&endash.click a :link reftype=hd refid='HelpIcons'.help
icon:elink. that is already set up
:p.&endash. Type "view :hp1.filename:ehp1." from the :link reftype=hd
refid='CommandLine'.command line:elink.
:p.&endash. Click the Open button
:artwork runin name='images\open.bmp'.
 from within NewView
:p.&endash. Reload a recently viewed file from the "File" menu
:p.&endash. Drag and drop a Help file from the desktop
:p.Once the file is loaded&comma. you should see the :link reftype=hd
refid='contents'.table of contents:elink. and the first topic&per.
:p.:hp5.Note&colon.:ehp5. This assumes you installed NewView as a replacement
for original View&per. If you didn&apos.t then existing help icons and the
command line may behave differently&per.
:p.:hp2.Loading Multiple Files Together:ehp2.
:p.NewView can load multiple files at once&comma. presenting them as if they
were one book&comma. and read environment variables for filenames&per.
:p.For example&comma. with the OS&slash.2 Developer&apos.s Toolkit
documentation&colon.
.br
  NewView cpref
.br
loads the "Control Program Guide and Reference"&per. CPREF is an environment
variable set in config&per.sys&comma. consisting of "CP1&plus.CP2&plus.CP3"
which tells NewView &lpar.or View&rpar. to load the help files CP1&comma. CP2
and CP3&per. The files are searched for in the path specified by two :link
reftype=hd refid='L_EnvironmentVariables'.environment
variables:elink.&per.&asterisk.
:p.The files are all loaded and effectively appended to each other&per.
:p.Being able to load multiple files like this can be helpful for various
reasons&per. For example&comma. 4OS&slash.2 &lpar.a CMD&per.EXE
replacement&rpar. uses it to add it&apos.s own help on top of the original CMD
help&per. You can do it yourself with any files you like&per.
:p.You can load multiple files in the Open File dialog by using Ctrl or Shift to
select multiple files&per.
:p.When you click a link to a different help file&comma. NewView loads the other
file without closing your current files&per.
:p.At any time&comma. you can find out what files are open by using File
&endash. Information&per.
:p.:hp2.Loading Additional Files:ehp2.
:p.You can tick the "Keep current files open" checkbox in the Open File
dialog&comma. and NewView will open the files you have selected without closing
the currently opened files&per.
:p.:hp2.Drag and Drop:ehp2.
:p.You can drag and drop &per.INF or &per.HLP files onto NewView and they will
be opened&per. If you hold down the Shift key&comma. they will be opened without
closing the current files&per.
:p.You can drop files onto any of the main content areas&comma. such as the
Contents or Index windows&comma. or an existing topic window&per.
:p.:hp5.Note:ehp5.
:p.Some links that go across files&comma. will only work if the correct set of
files is loaded&per.
:h2 res=17 id='HelpIcons'.
Help Icons
:p.:hp2.Help Icons:ehp2.
:p.Help Icons on the desktop are usually "program objects" with the program name
set to "view&per.exe" and the parameters set to the name of the help files&per.
:p.Some programs create these icons automatically at install time&per.
:p.You can create these icons yourself by using the desktop program
template&per. See desktop help for more information&per.
:p.If you create icons by dragging help files to the desktop&comma. then you
cannot give them a meaningful title&comma. because that would change the name of
the file&comma. which might prevent programs from finding the help file&per.
Therefore program objects are currently the recommended means of creating help
icons&per.
:h1 res=200 id='NavigationPanel'.
Navigation Panel Tabs
:p.:hp2.Navigation Panel Tabs:ehp2.
:p.The left hand panel contains several tabs for moving through the current help
file in different ways&per.
:p.:link reftype=hd refid='contents'.Contents:elink.
:p.:link reftype=hd refid='Index'.Index:elink.
:p.:link reftype=hd refid='search'.Search:elink.
:p.:link reftype=hd refid='notes'.Notes:elink.
:p.You can turn this panel off to get more space&comma. by selecting View
&endash. Show Left Panel from the menu&comma. or pressing Alt&plus.P&per. Do the
same to turn it on again&per.
:p.You can stop the navigation panel from appearing when a help file is opened
in Tools &endash. Options &endash. General tab&per.
:p.:hp2.Note&colon. :ehp2. Many programs choose to show the table of contents
when they open their help file&semi. in this case&comma. the panel is
automatically shown&comma. overriding your setting&per.
:h2 res=4 id='contents'.
Contents View
:i1 id=30006.Table of Contents
:p.:hp2.Table of Contents:ehp2.
:p.
:p.Most help files have a table of contents that shows you the topics in the
file&comma. in a hierarchy or "tree"&per. This is usually the first view you see
when you open a file&per.
:p.You can expand or collapse branches on the tree by clicking the &plus. or
&endash. buttons&comma. or using the space bar&per.
:p.To view a topic from the contents&comma. just click on it&per. You can also
move through the contents by using the arrow keys&per.
:p.To move through &asterisk.all&asterisk. topics in the contents tree&comma. in
order&comma. you can use Ctrl &plus. Up and Ctrl &plus. Down&comma. or the
"Previous"
:artwork runin name='images\previous.bmp'.
 and "Next"
:artwork runin name='images\next.bmp'.
 buttons&per. This is one way to treat the file as a normal book&comma. reading
through each page&per.
:p.You can also review the whole table of contents by using "Expand All" in the
"View" menu&per. This expands all the branches of the contents table so you can
quickly look through it&per. However&comma. it&apos.s usually easier to use
:link reftype=hd refid='search'.Search:elink. or :link reftype=hd
refid='Index'.Index:elink. for this purpose&per.
:h2 res=5 id='Index'.
Index
:p.:hp2.About the Index:ehp2.
:p.
:p.The Index tab contains an alphabetical listing of topics or keywords in the
help file&per. You can quickly search through it just by typing the first few
characters of the word you want to look up&per. NewView jumps to the first match
in the index automatically&per. To view the highlighted topic&comma. press
enter&per.
:p.:hp5.Notes:ehp5.
:p.Help files may or may not include an "official" index&per. The index is
manually created by the author&comma. so &lpar.for original View&rpar. it&apos.s
usefulness is strictly dependent on how much work the author put into it&per.
There may not even be one&per.
:p.However&comma. a useful index can be provided simply by listing the titles of
each topic alphabetically&comma. and this is what NewView does&per. It then
merges the original index &lpar.if any&rpar. with the list of topic titles&per.
:p.If for some reason you don&apos.t like this&comma. you can turn it off in
Tools &endash. Options &endash. Index tab&per.
:h2 res=6 id='search'.
Search
:p.:hp2.Searching:ehp2.
:p.
:p.Searching is a quick way to find information&comma. when you don&apos.t know
where to start&per. Simply go to the Search tab&comma. type some related words
and click the Search button&per.
:p.You&apos.ll see a listing of all topics containing that word&comma. or words
like it&comma. with the best matches at the top&per. The best match will be
displayed automatically&per.
:p.Words that matches your search are highlighted in the topic&per.
:p.:hp2.Global search:ehp2.
:p.You can also search all help files on your system using the :link reftype=hd
refid='GlobalSearch'.global search:elink. in Tools &endash. Search all Help
Files&per.
:p.:hp2.Phrase search:ehp2.
:p.If you want to search for a phrase made up of more than one word&comma. put
double quotes around it&comma. for example "os&slash.2 warp"&per.
:p.:hp2.Matching features:ehp2.
:p.NewView allows you finer control of searching&per.
:p.&plus. indicates a word that :hp2.must:ehp2. be matched
:p.&endash. indicates a word that must :hp2.not:ehp2. be matched
:p.NewView always does partial word matches&per. That is&comma. if you search
for "win" NewView will also find "window" and "showing"&per. However&comma. the
better the match is the higher the rank will be&per.
:p.:hp2.How NewView ranks results:ehp2.
:p.NewView ranks matching topics by various means&colon.
:p.&endash. a closer match to a full word
:p.&endash. number of matching words in a topic
:p.&endash. matches within the title
:p.&endash. matches within an index entry
:h2 res=7 id='notes'.
Notes
:p.:hp2.Adding and Using Notes:ehp2.
:p.
:p.NewView allows you to add notes &lpar.annotations&rpar. to your help
files&per.

"Note" button
:artwork runin name='images\notegreen.bmp'.
&comma. then type your text and click OK&per. The text will be inserted into the
help topic with a different color &lpar.default is green&semi. you can change
this in Tools &endash. Options &endash. Colors&rpar.&per.
:p.To edit or delete a note&comma. click on the colored note text&semi. you can
then edit the note text&comma. or click on delete to get rid of it&per.
:p.You can also review all the notes that you&apos.ve made in the current help
file&lpar.s&rpar. by going to the Notes tab&semi. this allows you to add&comma.
edit and delete&comma. and also jump to the topics containing your notes&per.
:p.
:p.Notes are saved in a file with the extension &per.nte&comma. in the same
directory as the help file they are for&per.
:p.Note &endash. if a help file is changed &lpar.for example a program is
upgraded&rpar. then notes will no longer appear in the correct place&semi.
however&comma. you can still read them from the Notes tab&per.
:h1 res=18 id='GlobalSearch'.
Global Search
:p.:hp2.Global search:ehp2.
:p.You can search all help files on your system&comma. by clicking the Search
All button
:artwork runin name='images\globalsearch2.bmp'.
&comma. using Tools &endash. Search all Help Files in the menu&comma. or
pressing Ctrl&plus.S&per.
:p.This search works similarly to :link reftype=hd refid='search'.searching
within a file:elink.&comma. but it also tells you what help file the results
were found in&per.
:p.These searches may take some time&comma. depending on what you search
for&per. You can stop the search at any time&per.
:p.:hp2.Where NewView searches:ehp2.

de&endash.select it&per. After you choose this&comma. the location will show as
"Selected Help Paths"
:p.:hp2.Search in&colon. All Hard Drives:ehp2.
:p.This option will search all hard &lpar.non&endash.removable&rpar. drives on
your system&per. You can click "Select&per.&per.&per." to customise the
location&per.
:p.Searching drives can find more help files&comma. but might be much slower

sub&endash.directories of the selected directory to be searched as well&per. In
this case&comma. &per.&per.&per. will show on the end of the directory&per.
:p.After you add a custom directory like this&comma. the location for searching
will show as "Directory List"&per.
:p.Note&colon. if you add a custom directory to standard or selected help

Environment Variables

:p.
:p.Both the :hp2.BOOKSHELF:ehp2. and :hp2.HELP:ehp2. environment variables
define paths &lpar.lists of directories&rpar. for searching for help files&per.
NewView uses both paths without distinction&per.
:p.These paths are searched when you&colon.
:p.o specify a help file without a path on the command line
:p.o use the File &endash. Open Special&per.&per.&per. menu item
:p.o do a :link reftype=hd refid='GlobalSearch'.global search:elink.
:p.You can permanently add directories of help files to the :hp2.HELP:ehp2. or
:hp2.BOOKSHELF:ehp2. paths by modifying the CONFIG&per.SYS file&per. Add to both
paths&comma. if you also want old view to be able to find the files&per.
:p.:hp2.Other environment variables:ehp2.

Writing Help Files
:p.:hp2.Writing OS&slash.2 Help Files :ehp2.
:p.
:p.OS&slash.2 Help Files are produced using the IPF Compiler&per. IPF stands for
Information Presentation Facility&per.
:p.The IPF Compiler takes a text file written in a language that tells it about
things like headings&comma. links&comma. text and images&comma. and produces
either a &per.INF or &per.HLP file&per.
:p.The official way to obtain the IPF compiler &lpar.ipfc&per.exe&rpar. is from
the OS&slash.2 Developers Toolkit&per. This is included free with eComStation
&lpar.http&colon.&slash.&slash.www&per.ecomstation&per.com&rpar.&per.
:p.Since the language for IPFC is tedious &lpar.for example all punctuation must
be typed as special keywords&comma. like &amp.comma&per.&rpar. many people use
other tools besides the IPF compiler itself&per.
:p.I use Vyperhelp
&lpar.http&colon.&slash.&slash.www&per.vyperhelp&per.com&rpar. since it is
simple and graphical&per. It can also export to Windows Help&comma. HTML and
others&comma. though it only runs on OS&slash.2&per. Not free&per.
:p.Some other popular options are&colon.
:p.o HyperText&slash.2 IPF Preprocessor
&lpar.http&colon.&slash.&slash.www&per.clanganke&per.de&slash.os2&slash.sw&slash.htext&slash.
.br
&rpar. &endash. preprocesses a simpler starting language into the very difficult
IPF format&per. Free&per.
:p.o HyperMake
&lpar.http&colon.&slash.&slash.www&per.hypermake&per.com&rpar.&per.
Similar&comma. but can also produce Windows Help and HTML&per.
:p.o Sibyl &lpar.which NewView was created with&rpar. comes with an IPF
preprocessor&per.
:p.o IPFEditor from PCS
&lpar.http&colon.&slash.&slash.www&per.pcs&endash.soft&per.com&slash.productipfe212&per.htm
.br
&rpar.&per. Probably the most complete&comma. but significant cost&per.
Note&colon. NewView doesn&apos.t support everything IPFE can do&xclm.
.br
In the past there were many other options&per. Those listed should still be
available and have some support&per.

Topic Resource IDs
:p.:hp2.Topic Resource IDs:ehp2.
:p.Resource IDs are used by authors of online help for applications&comma. to
identify help topics&per. Applications call the Help Manager specifying a
resource ID&comma. either directly using the HM&us.DISPLAY&us.HELP
message&comma. or indirectly via help tables added to their resources&comma.

:p.
:p.Like resource IDs&comma. topic names can be used by developers to link to
help topics from within their application&comma. using the HM&us.DISPLAY&us.HELP
message with parameter 2 being HM&us.PANELNAME&per.
:p.These are not so often used&per.
