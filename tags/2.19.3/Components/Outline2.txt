TOutline2

A new Outline (also known as a "Tree View") for Sibyl.
Main features: 
- lots of options
- more compact
- fast 
- more control over navigation through code 

See componentsTestForm.pas for examples of how to use.

Basically, to load items into the TOutline2 you use code like this:

var 
  Node: TNode;
begin
  Node:= TheOutline.AddChild( 'Seven', nil );
  Node:= Node.AddChild( 'Biscuit', nil );
  Node.AddChild( 'Afghan', nil );



Notes
-----


The scroll bars are checked for visibility only when
- the contents of the outline changes
- a "visible" node is expanded/collapsed

Node.IsVisible tells you if all a nodes' parents are expanded.
Not if it is physically on screen.

The scroll bar positions are updated at every refresh. The number of
physical lines "visible" in the whole outline is counted while painting.
When the topnode is found it's index from the top is stored in _TopLineIndex
and used to set the vertical scrollbar position.

During refresh the maximum width required is calculated, and used to decide
if a horizontal scroll bar is needed, and the position of the scrollbar

The horizontal scrollbar's position is the number of pixels to start drawing at...
